Projects Overview

This repository contains three projects demonstrating skills in Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning:

1. WhatsApp Data Analytics using NLTK


2. Voice-to-Text Data Analysis using NLP


3. Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)






1. WhatsApp Data Analytics using NLTK

Description:
Analyze WhatsApp chat data to extract insights like most active users, frequently used words, sentiment trends, and visualizations using Python.

Features:

Preprocessing chat data (removing emojis, timestamps, stopwords)

Tokenization and frequency analysis using NLTK

Wordcloud visualization for most used words

Sentiment analysis of messages

Graphs for active users, message trends, and emojis


Technologies/Libraries:
Python, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

How to Use:

1. Upload your WhatsApp chat export (.txt format).


2. Run the Python script (whatsapp_analysis.py).


3. View the generated reports and visualizations.






2. Voice-to-Text Data using NLP

Description:
Convert audio data into text and analyze it to extract insights using Speech Recognition and NLP techniques.

Features:

Audio transcription using speech-to-text models

Preprocessing text for analysis (stopwords removal, lemmatization)

Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction

Visualization of word frequency and sentiment trends


Technologies/Libraries:
Python, SpeechRecognition, NLTK, TextBlob, Pandas, Matplotlib

How to Use:

1. Provide audio input files (.wav or .mp3).


2. Run the script (voice_to_text_analysis.py).


3. Get transcribed text and analysis results.






3. Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

Description:
Detect brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Features:

Preprocessing of MRI images

CNN model for binary classification (tumor / no tumor)

Model training and evaluation (accuracy, loss curves)

Prediction on new MRI images


Technologies/Libraries:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

How to Use:

1. Prepare the MRI dataset (images in labeled folders).


2. Train the CNN model (brain_tumor_cnn.py) or use pre-trained weights.


3. Test predictions on new images.
